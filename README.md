## Coding exercise:

Implement a stopwatch in JavaScript. It can be implemented in any way you choose.
The only requirements are:

- The API should include the following:

  - start - a function that starts the timer
  - stop - a function that stops the timer, does not reset time value
  - reset - a function that resets the time value to zero
  - time - a function that outputs the current time value

- Timer should elapse in real time
- The timer should include hours:minutes:seconds
  - Example: 01:34:04.02
